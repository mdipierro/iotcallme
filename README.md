# IoT Call Me!

        
If you are working with IOT devices you may have the
need of triggering an immediate action remotely but a device is
behind a firewall or router and it is unreachable.
An example of such action is asking the device to contact
your server to receive further instructions (wake up, call me!)
We solved this problem for you.
